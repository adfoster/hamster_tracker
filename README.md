##Raspberry Pi Powered Hamster Pedometer

(The Internet)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roborovski_hamster] claims that Roborovski hamsters (the breed I own)
run "an equivalent of four human marathons each night on average".

This repo is part of a project to determine if my two pet hamsters -- Hamtaro and Hamtaro Grande -- can hold their own
against this claim.  Here's how it works:

##My hamster wheel is modded with a VCR head
For two reasons:
1. The ballbearings that are designed to play a video tape smoothly allow for relatively frictionless (and therefor
nearly silent) rotation. Silence is golden when living with nocturnal pets who supposedly run nightly marathons on their
wheel.

2. The VCR head has an axel which can reach through the wires of the cage and attach to the wheel. This is important because
it means I can mount the VCR head itself on the outside of the cage, allowing me to attach it to other objects outside of
hamster reach.
